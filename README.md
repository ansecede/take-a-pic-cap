# Take a Picap

This is a user UI I made using React as a demo to showcase a computer vision (Deep Learning) model developed by INARI in my time working there.

To run the app run in the root directory:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The app is incomplete because I had to remove some of the features for confidentiality reasons. In my free time I'm going to clean this project up a bit and adapt it to serve a new purpose. For now it just serves as a way for people to see what my code looks like.
